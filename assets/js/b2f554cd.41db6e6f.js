Nevertheless, this blog remains your spot for the key updates and announements.\\n\\nLet\'s dive into what\'s been happening with GameVault since release and what\'s on the horizon. We\'ve hit version 9 on the backend and 1.7 on the frontend, showcasing our commitment to continuous improvement.\\n\\nAlongside the usual optimizations and bug fixes, we\'ve been paying a lot of attention to your feature requests and implemented a bunch of them.\\n\\nHere\'s the highlight reel:\\n\\n- Auto Extraction and Installation of Videogames\\n- Uninstalling Games through GameVault\\n- Uploading Images\\n- Support for more Archive Formats\\n- Bandwidth Control Features\\n- Database Backups & Restorations\\n- Crash Reporting\\n- Random Game Finder\\n\\nSo, what\'s cooking now? We asked for your top three desired features recently, and here are the results:\\n\\n1. UI Redesign for the Library and Installations Tab\\n2. Support for ROMS and Emulators\\n3. Support for extra files like Soundtracks, Mods, etc.\\n\\nBy the way, if you want to take part in polls like this in the future aswell, make sure to become a council member on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu)!\\n\\nRight now we\'re knee-deep in redesigning the Library, the heart of our application. Big changes are on the way, waving goodbye to the installations tab and ushering in a sleeker UI for Library, Game View, and Game Settings.\\n\\nHere are some sneak peeks and mockups: (still work in progress):\\n\\n1. Library (Mockup)\\n   ![Filters](/img/blog/2023-11-19/filters.png)\\n   ![Empty States](/img/blog/2023-11-19/emptystates.png)\\n2.

Game Settings (Mockup)\\n   ![Game Settings](/img/blog/2023-11-19/settings.png)\\n\\nRemember, these are teasers. Anything can look different once it ships. There\'s a lot of work left, and we\'re on it. To be technical here: Most of these modern controls require us to rewrite WPF Controls from the core. On the backend, we\'re not slacking either \u2013 tons of end-to-end tests are being written to ensure our app\'s reliability.\\n\\nExcited about the new UI or got something to say? Head over to [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) and spill the beans!\\n\\nWe\'re eager to wrap up these tasks and ship the update out to you guys.\\n\\nWe also wanted to mention we\'ve already crossed 2000 GameVault users with a growing engaged [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) community of 350 members!\\n\\nAnd your donations help keeping the lights on, though we\'re not rolling in dough just yet. Every penny counts, and we\'re truly grateful. Thanks a lot. \u2764\ufe0f\\n\\nHelp us promote GameVault among fellow self-hosters.

The process of transitioning to the new name will commence very soon, and we can\'t wait to share the exciting updates with you.\\n\\nBut first, let\'s dive into the poll results and shed some light on the important facts without further delay:\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nIn total, 71 people participated in the poll, providing us with valuable data to draw conclusions from. Here\'s a summary of the key findings:\\n\\n- 52.1% of the community voted against using any terms related to piracy in the app. We understand and respect this choice because it would harm our business and attract the wrong users, as we have no affiliation with piracy.\\n\\n- 42.3% of the community voted to recommend the app under a different name but not with its current name. This feedback motivated us to rename the app, confirming that it wasn\'t just a few critics on Reddit. We want to expand our community to include the families, friends, and colleagues of these people. So please, help us spread the word about the name change!\\n\\n- 36.6% of you said you wouldn\'t contribute to our app at all solely because of its name, even if you had the opportunity. We depend on these contributions to grow and improve, so we now encourage you to participate!\\n\\nWithout further ado, here are the top 5 names that emerged as winners in the poll:\\n\\n1. GameStash (38%)\\n2. GameVault (35.2%)\\n3. GameShelf (31%)\\n4. Harbor (29.6%)\\n5. GameHub (28.2%)\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, we conducted the poll without conducting market analysis beforehand. However, we recognized the significance of making an informed decision for the benefit of the community. Consequently, we proceeded to analyze each name after the poll to ensure the chosen name resonates with our vision.\\n\\nAllow us to share the summarized results of our market analysis:\\n\\n## Market Analysis\\n\\n### 1. GameStash\\n\\nGoogle Search Results: ~33,600  \\nPossible Domains: gamestash.de\\n\\n- There\'s already an app called [GameStash](https://gamestash.app/) that offers similar features to ours.\\n\\n### 2. GameVault\\n\\nGoogle Search Results: ~800,000  \\nPossible Domains: gamevau.lt, game-vault.de\\n\\n- The term \\"GameVault\\" is associated with a popular online casino/gambling application called [GameVault999](https://gamevault999.com/).\\n\\n### 3.

Taking into account all the suggested names and feedback, we engaged in extensive internal brainstorming, free from outside influences.\\n\\nWe sought a name that is descriptive, intuitive, and effectively conveys the purpose of our app. Additionally, we aimed for a name that is easily memorable and emphasizes the ownership and control of a self-hosted server, security, and exclusivity.\\n\\nIntroducing our new name: **GameVault**  \\nAvailable soon under this domain: [gamevau.lt](https://gamevau.lt)\\n\\nWe have already secured the domain and registered the name wherever possible. The transition process will commence shortly. We are eager to hear your thoughts on the new name. Do you like it?\\n\\n## Special Thanks \u2764\ufe0f\\n\\nWell, as you all know, this was quite a journey to get here, and we wanted to give our special thanks to:\\n\\n- Everybody who gave this project\'s idea a chance, even if the name was kind of weird.\\n\\n- Everybody who made suggestions on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) server and participated in the discussions.\\n\\n- Everybody who voted.\\n\\n- A special shoutout to @KairuByte on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) for coming up with the name GameVault.\\n\\n- We would also like to extend our gratitude to [The Selfhosted Podcast](https://selfhosted.show/101?t=2731) for discussing our app. (Brent, we are excited to hear your thoughts on the new name from a marketing standpoint \ud83d\ude1c)\\n\\n- Last but not least, thank you to [The Self-Hosted Newsletter](https://selfh.st/newsletter/2023-07-07/) for mentioning our release.\\n\\nThank you all for your continued support!\\n\\nWe will keep you updated as the transition unfolds. In the meantime, head over to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) channel to celebrate and share your thoughts on the new name.\\n\\nOh, and by the way, just a heads up: The transition for the \\"crackpipe_user\\" field in the database might take a bit longer, because it will need a migration. It seems getting 500 users \\"off the crackpipe\\" isn\'t as easy as we thought! \ud83d\ude09\\n\\nStay tuned!"},{"id":"/2023/07/13/","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/07/13/","editUrl":"https://github.com/phalcode/gamevault-docs/tree/master/blog/2023-07-13.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-13.md","title":"A Closer Look at Crackpipes \'Source-Available\' Nature","description":"Hey everyone,","date":"2023-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 13, 2023","tags":[{"label":"source-available software","permalink":"/blog/tags/source-available-software"},{"label":"open-source","permalink":"/blog/tags/open-source"},{"label":"transparency","permalink":"/blog/tags/transparency"},{"label":"control","permalink":"/blog/tags/control"},{"label":"software development","permalink":"/blog/tags/software-development"},{"label":"code access","permalink":"/blog/tags/code-access"},{"label":"hybrid model","permalink":"/blog/tags/hybrid-model"},{"label":"software licensing","permalink":"/blog/tags/software-licensing"},{"label":"revenue generation","permalink":"/blog/tags/revenue-generation"},{"label":"user engagement","permalink":"/blog/tags/user-engagement"}],"readingTime":2.535,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Alper Alkan","title":"Co-Founder of Phalcode","url":"https://github.com/Alfagun74","imageURL":"https://github.com/Alfagun74.png","key":"alfagun74"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"A Closer Look at Crackpipes \'Source-Available\' Nature","authors":["alfagun74"],"tags":["source-available software","open-source","transparency","control","software development","code access","hybrid model","software licensing","revenue generation","user engagement"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"A New Name","permalink":"/blog/2023/07/15/"},"nextItem":{"title":"Battling Harassment and Trolls in Our App Community","permalink":"/blog/2023/07/09/"}},"content":"Hey everyone,\\n\\ntoday i want to clarify why Crackpipe isn\'t considered \\"open-source\\" by definition.\\n\\nYou see, Crackpipe is what we like to call [\\"source-available\\"](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software) software. This means that our code is open for you to explore and modify, but it doesn\'t fully meet all the criteria of being considered open-source. I want to take a moment to explain what open-source truly means and why we\'ve taken a slightly different approach.\\n\\nAccording to the widely recognized definitions, [\\"open-source\\"](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) software, as one would think, not only provides access to the source code but also offers certain freedoms to its users. It allows them to use, modify, and distribute the software freely, even for commercial purposes.\\n\\nFor a self-hosted app like Crackpipe, we believe it\'s crucual to disclose the source code. We want you, our users, to have full transparency and control over the software you use on your servers. We don\'t want you to be unaware of what\'s happening behind the scenes, as is sometimes the case with closed-source applications like Plex, for example.\\n\\nNow, you may be wondering why we didn\'t make Crackpipe fully open-source. The answer lies in our desire to protect our code from unauthorized use and commercial exploitation. While we absolutely encourage you to copy, modify, and share our code for personal use, we want to prevent others from profiting off our hard work by selling our software without our consent.\\n\\nIt\'s important to acknowledge that maintaining and developing a software project requires resources. While we admire the open-source community and its valuable contributions, sustaining Crackpipe solely through donations or offering it for free indefinitely is not feasible. For instance, Jellyfin, a popular open-source app developed over a decade, generates only around $13,500 per year (according to their opencollective page). In contrast, Plex, a closed-source alternative, earns a significant $8.5 million annually. Our company\'s main goal is to keep the core functionality of Crackpipe free, but we also need to explore ways to generate revenue in order to support its future growth and improvement. We are currently considering monetizing additional convenience features for the Client Application in the future, although nothing has been finalized yet.\\n\\nWe genuinely appreciate your understanding. As a small business with just two members, we strive to provide you with a valuable product but cannot continue to do so as volunteers indefinitely. Sustaining losses in the long term would not be sustainable, especially considering our local tax obligations. We have families and commitments that cannot be neglected, and this project is not our primary job. Therefore, please understand that Crackpipe may not strictly align with the traditional definition of \\"open-source,\\" and we no longer characterize it as such. Our intention is to be transparent and present our perspective. Your understanding, support, and empathy mean a great deal to us.\\n\\nIf you have any thoughts or comments on this topic, we\'d be more than happy to hear from you. Feel free to share your feedback on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) server. We truly value your input and look forward to engaging with you there."},{"id":"/2023/07/09/","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/07/09/","editUrl":"https://github.com/phalcode/gamevault-docs/tree/master/blog/2023-07-09.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-09.md","title":"Battling Harassment and Trolls in Our App Community","description":"Hey folks,","date":"2023-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 9, 2023","tags":[{"label":"harassment","permalink":"/blog/tags/harassment"},{"label":"blackmail","permalink":"/blog/tags/blackmail"},{"label":"threats","permalink":"/blog/tags/threats"},{"label":"spam","permalink":"/blog/tags/spam"},{"label":"trolls","permalink":"/blog/tags/trolls"},{"label":"negative narratives","permalink":"/blog/tags/negative-narratives"},{"label":"safe environment","permalink":"/blog/tags/safe-environment"},{"label":"racist","permalink":"/blog/tags/racist"},{"label":"developers","permalink":"/blog/tags/developers"},{"label":"public","permalink":"/blog/tags/public"},{"label":"creepy behavior","permalink":"/blog/tags/creepy-behavior"},{"label":"app","permalink":"/blog/tags/app"},{"label":"support","permalink":"/blog/tags/support"},{"label":"financial assistance","permalink":"/blog/tags/financial-assistance"},{"label":"motivation","permalink":"/blog/tags/motivation"},{"label":"Crackpipe app","permalink":"/blog/tags/crackpipe-app"},{"label":"bugs","permalink":"/blog/tags/bugs"},{"label":"feature requests","permalink":"/blog/tags/feature-requests"},{"label":"improvement","permalink":"/blog/tags/improvement"},{"label":"success","permalink":"/blog/tags/success"},{"label":"engagement","permalink":"/blog/tags/engagement"}],"readingTime":1.935,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Alper Alkan","title":"Co-Founder of Phalcode","url":"https://github.com/Alfagun74","imageURL":"https://github.com/Alfagun74.png","key":"alfagun74"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Battling Harassment and Trolls in Our App Community","authors":["alfagun74"],"tags":["harassment","blackmail","threats","spam","trolls","negative narratives","safe environment","racist","developers","public","creepy behavior","app","support","financial assistance","motivation","Crackpipe app","bugs","feature requests","improvement","success","engagement"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"A Closer Look at Crackpipes \'Source-Available\' Nature","permalink":"/blog/2023/07/13/"},"nextItem":{"title":"Choosing a New, Family-Friendly Name for Crackpipe!","permalink":"/blog/2023/07/08/"}},"content":"Hey folks,\\n\\nWe have an important update to share with you all while our poll is in progress. It has come to our attention that a group of individuals has been engaging in harassing, blackmailing, and threatening behavior towards us.\\n\\nIt began with spam on our Issue Trackers and [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) Server but this situation has escalated to the point where these individuals went so far as to search me up on LinkedIn and threaten to inform my employer with baseless accusations of racism because of trivial reasons like the branch name in our github project being \\"master\\". Moreover, we have received reports that these trolls have extended their actions directly to other members of this server, attempting to spread negative narratives and disrupting the community atmosphere.\\n\\nTo address this issue, we kindly request that you promptly report any encounters with these trolls to both [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) and our dedicated team of moderators. By doing so, we can take appropriate measures to handle the situation and maintain a safe environment for all.\\n\\nWe would like to emphasize that we are not racist individuals, but rather developers who decided to share our hard work with the community, hoping to bring joy and utility to everyone. Unfortunately, we did not anticipate encountering such creepy behavior when we made the project public. It has made us question whether it was the right decision to open up our work in the first place.\\n\\nIf you appreciate our efforts and would like to support us and the app, we humbly ask for your financial assistance. Even a small contribution of $5 on [Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/phalcode) would go a long way in helping us maintain our motivation and dedication. Alternatively, if monetary support isn\'t possible, we would be incredibly grateful if you could share kind words about how the Crackpipe app has positively impacted your life in the #chat channel. Your encouragement means the world to us. \ud83e\udd70\\n\\nIn addition, we encourage you to continue reporting any bugs you encounter and submitting feature requests in the respective GitHub trackers. With your valuable input, we can continue improving the app and making it even better.\\n\\nRemember, the success of this project relies on your support and engagement. Let\'s stand together against these trolls and ensure a positive and inclusive community experience.

We recently launched our app and shared it on [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/14pdu0m/introducing_crackpipe_your_decentralized), and it has sparked some controversies. We want to take this opportunity to address the feedback and allegations in an official statement.\\n\\nSo let\'s go through the controversies:\\n\\n#### Regarding the name Crackpipe\\n\\nWe want to clarify that the name \\"Crackpipe\\" was initially meant as an inside joke between me and my friend, intended for a tool used by a limited audience. We just got used to it and went on, when deciding to release it to the public. We understand that some find the name inappropriate or uncomfortable, and we sincerely apologize for any distress caused. We are open to renaming the entire application to ensure it aligns better with our community\'s values. Your input is essential to us, so please [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) and share your creative suggestions for a new name in the #new-name channel. Soon, we\'ll have a public poll on our blog where you can vote for your favorite name or the existing one.\\n\\n#### Clarification on the term \\"liberal\\"\\n\\nAs non-native English speakers, we made an oversight in using the term \\"liberal,\\" which we intended to mean \\"free\\" or \\"libre.\\" We have already rectified this mistake.\\n\\n#### The use of Pepe the Frog as a profile picture\\n\\nWe apologize for not being aware of the misuse of the Pepe the Frog meme as a symbol of Nazis and white supremacism. That misuse is not a thing in europe. Originally, we only knew the frog as a twitch emote/meme and used it without any harmful intentions. In response to your feedback, we have changed the profile picture to a cute penguin.\\n\\n#### Addressing concerns about piracy\\n\\nWe\'d like to emphasize that our app isn\'t intended for unlawful activities, which include piracy. When we refer to DRM-free games, we still imply games that are acquired legally. This encompasses legitimate sources like archive.org, GOG, or the Humble Trove. Our goal is to consolidate your games in one location, given that they are part of the RAWG Database.\\n\\n#### Regarding the origins of the application\\n\\nWe assure you that this application was entirely developed by us, and any similarity to other projects is purely coincidental. We cleaned up our repositories to remove meaningless commits before going public, which may have caused confusion.\\n\\n#### On the marketing strategy\\n\\nWe want to clarify that the controversy surrounding the app was not a planned marketing stunt. As programmers that developed this in spare time, we simply did not anticipate such a strong reaction to a free app.\\n\\n#### Transparancy regarding financial and future plans\\n\\nCurrently, we rely on your [financial support through Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/phalcode). Building an active and engaged user base is our primary focus before considering the addition of any paid features in the future. So for now just enjoy the functionalities.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn conclusion, we appreciate all the feedback and kind words we have received. If you believe in the app\'s concept but are concerned about the current name, please feel free to suggest a new one and participate in the voting process on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu).\\n\\nWe are determined to improve and grow, and despite the bumpy start, we hope you\'ll enjoy the app and its functionality. We look forward to fostering a vibrant and supportive community around it.\\n\\nFor further updates, you can follow our blog. And new posts will also be shared on our Reddit, Lemmy and [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) server."},{"id":"/2023/07/01/","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/07/01/","editUrl":"https://github.com/phalcode/gamevault-docs/tree/master/blog/2023-07-01.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-01.md","title":"Introducing Crackpipe \ud83d\ude80 - The self-hosted gaming platform for DRM-free games","description":"Hey Guys,","date":"2023-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 1, 2023","tags":[{"label":"gaming","permalink":"/blog/tags/gaming"},{"label":"Crackpipe","permalink":"/blog/tags/crackpipe"},{"label":"source-available","permalink":"/blog/tags/source-available"},{"label":"self-hosted","permalink":"/blog/tags/self-hosted"},{"label":"alternative","permalink":"/blog/tags/alternative"},{"label":"cloud-based game platforms","permalink":"/blog/tags/cloud-based-game-platforms"},{"label":"DRM-free games","permalink":"/blog/tags/drm-free-games"},{"label":"file server","permalink":"/blog/tags/file-server"},{"label":"multi-user authentication","permalink":"/blog/tags/multi-user-authentication"},{"label":"metadata","permalink":"/blog/tags/metadata"},{"label":"RAWG API","permalink":"/blog/tags/rawg-api"},{"label":"health monitoring","permalink":"/blog/tags/health-monitoring"},{"label":"API","permalink":"/blog/tags/api"},{"label":"Discord server","permalink":"/blog/tags/discord-server"},{"label":"Reddit forum","permalink":"/blog/tags/reddit-forum"},{"label":"Lemmy forum","permalink":"/blog/tags/lemmy-forum"}],"readingTime":1.78,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Alper Alkan","title":"Co-Founder of Phalcode","url":"https://github.com/Alfagun74","imageURL":"https://github.com/Alfagun74.png","key":"alfagun74"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Introducing Crackpipe \ud83d\ude80 - The self-hosted gaming platform for DRM-free games","authors":["alfagun74"],"tags":["gaming","Crackpipe","source-available","self-hosted","alternative","cloud-based game platforms","DRM-free games","file server","multi-user authentication","metadata","RAWG API","health monitoring","API","Discord server","Reddit forum","Lemmy forum"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"A Bumpy Start - Addressing Feedback and Looking Forward","permalink":"/blog/2023/07/03/"}},"content":"Hey Guys,\\n\\nOur team has been working tirelessly for the past year on creating Crackpipe, the source-available, self-hosted, and free alternative to traditional cloud-based game platforms like Steam, Origin, Epic Games, and GoG.
