Whether you\'re battling fierce foes, exploring vast virtual worlds, or simply passing the time with a quick puzzle game, GameVault ensures that the thrill of gaming is always at your fingertips.\\n\\nThanks to the seamless integration with Microsoft Silverlight, navigating through your game library has never been smoother or more intuitive. The Metro Live Tiles add a touch of elegance to the user interface, making it a joy to browse through your collection and discover new games.\\n\\nAnd the best part? This is just the beginning. Our team is already hard at work on further enhancements and features, including the highly anticipated Holodeck edition of GameVault aswell as the new integrated \\"Bird Feeding Timer\\" feature, that automatically warns you when your pets are about to starve.\\n\\nWe\'re incredibly excited to embark on this journey with you and to continue pushing the boundaries of innovation.

In fact, quite the opposite has been happening behind the scenes.\\n\\nWhen my friend and I first launched this application, it was born out of a simple need for a solution to a problem we thought was very particular and only for ourselves. Having a steam-like platform for game files lying on my home server.\\n\\nWe never imagined it would resonate with others or find its own place in the market. Frankly, we thought it might end up just another forgotten repository on GitHub, gathering virtual dust with no one paying it any mind.\\n\\nBut boy, were we wrong. The response to our app was unexpectedly large and overwhelming. Thousands of people are using GameVault today, and it seems there\'s quite a demand out there for the exact product we\'ve been building.\\n\\nWe\u2019re a small indie team of two and despite juggling multiple jobs, we\'ve poured our hearts and souls into this project during our spare times, striving to offer a self-hosted alternative to the gaming platforms out there. And while we\'ve received some generous donations (_shoutout to our two loyal monthly donors btw \u2013 you know who you are, and we\'re endlessly grateful!_), it\'s clear that relying solely on sporadic tips isn\'t sustainable for the long term and we need financial support to maintain our services and justify our time investment towards our families.\\n\\nSo, it\'s time for a slight change. We\'re thrilled to announce the upcoming release of a new version of our client application, complete with an **optional** subscription model we\'re calling...\\n\\n## [GameVault+](https://gamevau.lt/docs/gamevault-plus/introduction)\\n\\n## What is GameVault+?\\n\\nFirst, to clear some of the confusion:\\n\\n**No, this is not some shady scammy \\"We\'re going enterprise\\" rugpull**.\\nThe core of GameVaults upcoming features and the features you enjoyed until now will always remain free. Additionally the system is [designed to be easily bypassed if you can\'t or dont want to afford it.](https://gamevau.lt/docs/gamevault-plus/introduction/#what-if-i-cant-afford-gamevault)\\n\\n[It was long planned on our board and well discussed within our community](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-app/issues/151). Think of [GameVault+](https://gamevau.lt/docs/gamevault-plus/introduction) as our way of saying \\"thank you\\" to our supporters and to motivate them to support us regularly. To be more specific, it\'s us giving back some goodie-features that are not necessarily needed to use GameVault back to our supporters, while they help us keep the lights on here at Phalcode.\\n\\nWith GameVault+, you\'ll gain access to premium nice-to-have features designed to enhance your GameVault experience, all for a small monthly fee of \u20ac4,99 monthly or \u20ac49.90 anually.\\n\\nCurrently, these features include:\\n\\n- Uploading animated profile pictures\\n- Applying Custom Themes\\n- Activation of the GameVault Client API (CLI, URI, and NamedPipe Interfaces Used for client integrations with 3rd party tools like Playnite)\\n\\nBut there are more to come! We will be enhancing this offering with more features, whenever we see room for it, as GameVault+ subscribers are the ones, who keep this project alive.\\n\\nAll details and a Q&A are on the [GameVault+ page](https://gamevau.lt/docs/gamevault-plus/introduction).\\n\\n**We\'ll be rolling out this new product today to our early access users first** to get the product and the infrastructure around it tested, tweaking and refining it based on your feedback before making it available to everyone. It\'s an exciting new chapter for us, and we can\'t wait to have you along for the ride.\\n\\n## So what\'s next?\\n\\nWe will polish the rough edges of GameVault+ and bring it to life in the next few weeks, hopefully. You will probably already see some documentation on this website for it. Keep in mind, this is all a work in progress, and we will announce the final release soon.\\n\\nAfter that, we will need to urgently find a solution to our heavy reliance on the [degrading and unmaintained RAWG Database](https://discord.com/channels/1100920639667306496/1134496308846137404/1217726870959820861). We are already in contact for potential partnerships with Video-Game Databases.\\n\\nFinally, we will need to do some refactoring of our client application\'s architecture.\\n\\nBut stay tuned because once all of this is done, the Next Big Feature we\'ll be focusing on will be open for **the community to decide** in [our #polls channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu).

We\'ve hit version 9 on the backend and 1.7 on the frontend, showcasing our commitment to continuous improvement.\\n\\nAlongside the usual optimizations and bug fixes, we\'ve been paying a lot of attention to your feature requests and implemented a bunch of them.\\n\\nHere\'s the highlight reel:\\n\\n- Auto Extraction and Installation of Videogames\\n- Uninstalling Games through GameVault\\n- Uploading Images\\n- Support for more Archive Formats\\n- Bandwidth Control Features\\n- Database Backups & Restorations\\n- Crash Reporting\\n- Random Game Finder\\n\\nSo, what\'s cooking now? We asked for your top three desired features recently, and here are the results:\\n\\n1. UI Redesign for the Library and Installations Tab\\n2. Support for ROMS and Emulators\\n3. Support for extra files like Soundtracks, Mods, etc.\\n\\nBy the way, if you want to take part in polls like this in the future aswell, make sure to become a council member on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu)!\\n\\nRight now we\'re knee-deep in redesigning the Library, the heart of our application. Big changes are on the way, waving goodbye to the installations tab and ushering in a sleeker UI for Library, Game View, and Game Settings.\\n\\nHere are some sneak peeks and mockups: (still work in progress):\\n\\n1. Library (Mockup)\\n   ![Filters](/img/blog/2023-11-19/filters.png)\\n   ![Empty States](/img/blog/2023-11-19/emptystates.png)\\n2.

Game Settings (Mockup)\\n   ![Game Settings](/img/blog/2023-11-19/settings.png)\\n\\nRemember, these are teasers. Anything can look different once it ships. There\'s a lot of work left, and we\'re on it. To be technical here: Most of these modern controls require us to rewrite WPF Controls from the core. On the backend, we\'re not slacking either \u2013 tons of end-to-end tests are being written to ensure our app\'s reliability.\\n\\nExcited about the new UI or got something to say? Head over to [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) and spill the beans!\\n\\nWe\'re eager to wrap up these tasks and ship the update out to you guys.\\n\\nWe also wanted to mention we\'ve already crossed 2000 GameVault users with a growing engaged [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) community of 350 members!\\n\\nAnd your donations help keeping the lights on, though we\'re not rolling in dough just yet.

The process of transitioning to the new name will commence very soon, and we can\'t wait to share the exciting updates with you.\\n\\nBut first, let\'s dive into the poll results and shed some light on the important facts without further delay:\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nIn total, 71 people participated in the poll, providing us with valuable data to draw conclusions from. Here\'s a summary of the key findings:\\n\\n- 52.1% of the community voted against using any terms related to piracy in the app. We understand and respect this choice because it would harm our business and attract the wrong users, as we have no affiliation with piracy.\\n\\n- 42.3% of the community voted to recommend the app under a different name but not with its current name. This feedback motivated us to rename the app, confirming that it wasn\'t just a few critics on Reddit. We want to expand our community to include the families, friends, and colleagues of these people. So please, help us spread the word about the name change!\\n\\n- 36.6% of you said you wouldn\'t contribute to our app at all solely because of its name, even if you had the opportunity. We depend on these contributions to grow and improve, so we now encourage you to participate!\\n\\nWithout further ado, here are the top 5 names that emerged as winners in the poll:\\n\\n1. GameStash (38%)\\n2. GameVault (35.2%)\\n3. GameShelf (31%)\\n4. Harbor (29.6%)\\n5. GameHub (28.2%)\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, we conducted the poll without conducting market analysis beforehand. However, we recognized the significance of making an informed decision for the benefit of the community. Consequently, we proceeded to analyze each name after the poll to ensure the chosen name resonates with our vision.\\n\\nAllow us to share the summarized results of our market analysis:\\n\\n## Market Analysis\\n\\n### 1. GameStash\\n\\nGoogle Search Results: ~33,600  \\nPossible Domains: gamestash.de\\n\\n- There\'s already an app called [GameStash](https://gamestash.app/) that offers similar features to ours.\\n\\n### 2. GameVault\\n\\nGoogle Search Results: ~800,000  \\nPossible Domains: gamevau.lt, game-vault.de\\n\\n- The term \\"GameVault\\" is associated with a popular online casino/gambling application called [GameVault999](https://gamevault999.com/).\\n\\n### 3. GameShelf\\n\\nGoogle Search Results: ~560,000  \\nPossible Domains: gameshelf.de\\n\\n- The name \\"Gameshelf\\" is already used by two existing applications. One is a [Board-Game-Collection Viewer](https://gameshelf.io/), and the other is a [Gaming Backlog](https://gameshelf.dev) app.\\n\\n### 4. Harbor\\n\\nGoogle Search Results: ~393,000,000  \\nPossible Domains: harborapp.de\\n\\n- \\"Harbor\\" is a very common word, making it challenging to find a suitable domain that aligns with our brand identity.\\n\\n- Additionally, there\'s a well-known app called [Harbor on the Market](https://goharbor.io) related to Docker/Kubernetes.\\n\\n### 5. GameHub\\n\\nGoogle Search Results: ~5,690,000\\nPossible Domains: gamehubapp.de\\n\\n- [GameHub](https://github.com/tkashkin/GameHub) is a popular game library manager\\n- it also sounds like a popular adult site \ud83d\ude01\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\n\\nWe understand your eagerness for a new name, and we are equally committed to distancing ourselves from the old one. Taking into account all the suggested names and feedback, we engaged in extensive internal brainstorming, free from outside influences.\\n\\nWe sought a name that is descriptive, intuitive, and effectively conveys the purpose of our app. Additionally, we aimed for a name that is easily memorable and emphasizes the ownership and control of a self-hosted server, security, and exclusivity.\\n\\nIntroducing our new name: **GameVault**  \\nAvailable soon under this domain: [gamevau.lt](https://gamevau.lt)\\n\\nWe have already secured the domain and registered the name wherever possible. The transition process will commence shortly. We are eager to hear your thoughts on the new name. Do you like it?\\n\\n## Special Thanks \u2764\ufe0f\\n\\nWell, as you all know, this was quite a journey to get here, and we wanted to give our special thanks to:\\n\\n- Everybody who gave this project\'s idea a chance, even if the name was kind of weird.\\n\\n- Everybody who made suggestions on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) server and participated in the discussions.\\n\\n- Everybody who voted.\\n\\n- A special shoutout to @KairuByte on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) for coming up with the name GameVault.\\n\\n- We would also like to extend our gratitude to [The Selfhosted Podcast](https://selfhosted.show/101?t=2731) for discussing our app. (Brent, we are excited to hear your thoughts on the new name from a marketing standpoint \ud83d\ude1c)\\n\\n- Last but not least, thank you to [The Self-Hosted Newsletter](https://selfh.st/newsletter/2023-07-07/) for mentioning our release.\\n\\nThank you all for your continued support!\\n\\nWe will keep you updated as the transition unfolds.

This means that our code is open for you to explore and modify, but it doesn\'t fully meet all the criteria of being considered open-source. I want to take a moment to explain what open-source truly means and why we\'ve taken a slightly different approach.\\n\\nAccording to the widely recognized definitions, [\\"open-source\\"](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) software, as one would think, not only provides access to the source code but also offers certain freedoms to its users. It allows them to use, modify, and distribute the software freely, even for commercial purposes.\\n\\nFor a self-hosted app like GameVault, we believe it\'s crucual to disclose the source code. We want you, our users, to have full transparency and control over the software you use on your servers. We don\'t want you to be unaware of what\'s happening behind the scenes, as is sometimes the case with closed-source applications like Plex, for example.\\n\\nNow, you may be wondering why we didn\'t make GameVault fully open-source. The answer lies in our desire to protect our code from unauthorized use and commercial exploitation. While we absolutely encourage you to copy, modify, and share our code for personal use, we want to prevent others from profiting off our hard work by selling our software without our consent.\\n\\nIt\'s important to acknowledge that maintaining and developing a software project requires resources. While we admire the open-source community and its valuable contributions, sustaining GameVault solely through donations or offering it for free indefinitely is not feasible. For instance, Jellyfin, a popular open-source app developed over a decade, generates only around $13,500 per year (according to their opencollective page). In contrast, Plex, a closed-source alternative, earns a significant $8.5 million annually. Our company\'s main goal is to keep the core functionality of GameVault free, but we also need to explore ways to generate revenue in order to support its future growth and improvement. We are currently considering monetizing additional convenience features for the Client Application in the future, although nothing has been finalized yet.\\n\\nWe genuinely appreciate your understanding. As a small business with just two members, we strive to provide you with a valuable product but cannot continue to do so as volunteers indefinitely. Sustaining losses in the long term would not be sustainable, especially considering our local tax obligations. We have families and commitments that cannot be neglected, and this project is not our primary job. Therefore, please understand that GameVault may not strictly align with the traditional definition of \\"open-source,\\" and we no longer characterize it as such. Our intention is to be transparent and present our perspective. Your understanding, support, and empathy mean a great deal to us.\\n\\nIf you have any thoughts or comments on this topic, we\'d be more than happy to hear from you. Feel free to share your feedback on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) server. We truly value your input and look forward to engaging with you there.\\n\\n``EDIT: Updated Application Name``"},{"id":"/2023/07/09/","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/07/09/","editUrl":"https://github.com/phalcode/gamevault-docs/tree/master/blog/2023-07-09.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-09.md","title":"Battling Harassment and Trolls in Our App Community","description":"Hey folks,","date":"2023-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"harassment","permalink":"/blog/tags/harassment"},{"label":"blackmail","permalink":"/blog/tags/blackmail"},{"label":"threats","permalink":"/blog/tags/threats"},{"label":"spam","permalink":"/blog/tags/spam"},{"label":"trolls","permalink":"/blog/tags/trolls"},{"label":"negative narratives","permalink":"/blog/tags/negative-narratives"},{"label":"safe environment","permalink":"/blog/tags/safe-environment"},{"label":"racist","permalink":"/blog/tags/racist"},{"label":"developers","permalink":"/blog/tags/developers"},{"label":"public","permalink":"/blog/tags/public"},{"label":"creepy behavior","permalink":"/blog/tags/creepy-behavior"},{"label":"app","permalink":"/blog/tags/app"},{"label":"support","permalink":"/blog/tags/support"},{"label":"financial assistance","permalink":"/blog/tags/financial-assistance"},{"label":"motivation","permalink":"/blog/tags/motivation"},{"label":"GameVault app","permalink":"/blog/tags/game-vault-app"},{"label":"bugs","permalink":"/blog/tags/bugs"},{"label":"feature requests","permalink":"/blog/tags/feature-requests"},{"label":"improvement","permalink":"/blog/tags/improvement"},{"label":"success","permalink":"/blog/tags/success"},{"label":"engagement","permalink":"/blog/tags/engagement"}],"readingTime":1.94,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Alper Alkan","title":"Co-Founder of Phalcode","url":"https://github.com/Alfagun74","imageURL":"https://github.com/Alfagun74.png","key":"alfagun74"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Battling Harassment and Trolls in Our App Community","authors":["alfagun74"],"tags":["harassment","blackmail","threats","spam","trolls","negative narratives","safe environment","racist","developers","public","creepy behavior","app","support","financial assistance","motivation","GameVault app","bugs","feature requests","improvement","success","engagement"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"A Closer Look at GameVaults \'Source-Available\' Nature","permalink":"/blog/2023/07/13/"},"nextItem":{"title":"Choosing a New, Family-Friendly Name for this project!","permalink":"/blog/2023/07/08/"}},"content":"Hey folks,\\n\\nWe have an important update to share with you all while our poll is in progress. It has come to our attention that a group of individuals has been engaging in harassing, blackmailing, and threatening behavior towards us.\\n\\nIt began with spam on our Issue Trackers and [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) Server but this situation has escalated to the point where these individuals went so far as to search me up on LinkedIn and threaten to inform my employer with baseless accusations of racism because of trivial reasons like the branch name in our github project being \\"master\\". Moreover, we have received reports that these trolls have extended their actions directly to other members of this server, attempting to spread negative narratives and disrupting the community atmosphere.\\n\\nTo address this issue, we kindly request that you promptly report any encounters with these trolls to both [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) and our dedicated team of moderators.

Unfortunately, we did not anticipate encountering such creepy behavior when we made the project public. It has made us question whether it was the right decision to open up our work in the first place.\\n\\nIf you appreciate our efforts and would like to support us and the app, we humbly ask for your financial assistance. Even a small contribution of five bucks on [Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/phalcode) would go a long way in helping us maintain our motivation and dedication.

We are excited to share that GameVault is now available for everyone to use, and we are delighted to disclose it to the community.\\n\\nWith GameVault, you can play and track games together with your friends on a shared file server, free from any restrictions that traditional game platforms may impose. We have designed it to work with DRM-free games, providing a unique solution for those who want a more flexible and open approach to gaming. Think of it like Jellyfin, but for Videogames.\\n\\nGameVault offers a self-hosted approach that gives you complete control over your gaming experience. The platform enables you to browse your server\'s game collection, securely download games, launch and play them, and even track your playtimes and progress - regardless of whether the server is offline. Additionally, you can compare stats and play states with other users on the server.\\n\\nOur server features offer automatic indexing of games on the file system into a database, enrichment of games with metadata like tags and genres using RAWG API, multi-user authentication, and configurable logging. We have also implemented health monitoring, full-text search, filters, sorting, pagination, and a fully documented API. The GameVault platform is highly configurable to suit your needs.\\n\\nWe are thrilled that you have found us, and we invite you to try GameVault today. We would be grateful for any contributions, feedback, bug reports, and feature requests you might have. You can also support us by donating using the links provided on our website. If you have any questions or would like to connect with other GameVault users, please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu), Reddit and Lemmy communities - links to which are available in the footer.\\n\\nWe are passionate about creating a gaming experience that is more open, flexible, and enjoyable for everyone. We hope you will join us on this journey and experience the benefits of a truly source-available alternative to traditional game platforms with GameVault."}]}}')}}]);
