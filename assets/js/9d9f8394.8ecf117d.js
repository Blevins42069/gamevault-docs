We've already encountered a couple users facing this issue. Despite countless hours of analysis and debugging, we attempted almost everything to enable the code to run on both older and newer hardware, even considering switching to another library.

We conducted a poll, and the results were clear: official support for old hardware should be discontinued. We reached out to the community, urging them to maintain an active fork of gamevault backend with compression completely removed, and the latest update suggests that people have started working on it.
