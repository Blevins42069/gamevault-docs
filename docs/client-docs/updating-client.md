# Updating the Client

The process for updating the app depends on the installation source.

## Microsoft Store

If you obtained the app from the Microsoft Store, we're pleased to inform you that our Client app features an automatic update functionality through the Microsoft Store. When you launch the app and observe the spinning logo, it automatically checks for available updates. If a new version is detected, the app prompts you to install it. After the update is installed, the application will close, and you'll need to manually restart it. Once restarted, you'll be using the most recent version.

## Other Sources

If you acquired the app from a different source, such as by self-compiling, extracting it from the .appxbundle, or downloading the binaries from GitHub, it becomes your responsibility to stay updated with the latest releases and perform the installations.

Be sure to [join our Discord community](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) and watch our Github Projects to stay informed about the latest advancements.
