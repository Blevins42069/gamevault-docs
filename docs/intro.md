# Introduction

## What is GameVault

GameVault ([formerly known as "Crackpipe"](https://gamevau.lt/blog/2023/07/15)) is an innovative gaming platform providing a self-hosted, [source-available](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software) alternative to popular gaming platforms. It lets you and your friends enjoy DRM-free games stored **on your file server** in an organized way.

Think of it as your personal Steam for your DRM-free video game collection. You bring your own game files (installers, binaries, etc.) from wherever you have them, and the platform detects them, enriches them with metadata and offers a user-friendly interface to easily organize, download, install, and play your games. It even tracks your playtimes and progress.

You cannot purchase or stream games using this platform. The GameVault system has two main components: a self-hosted Backend Server and one or more App Clients for you and your friends.

:::warning Legal Disclaimer
GameVault manages DRM-free games and is solely a tool to address this need. We are not responsible for the content or files users store or share.

When we say DRM-free games, we only mean games obtained legally. While GameVault _can_ theoretically be used with illegally obtained games, we do not endorse or support piracy.

Users must also be aware of and comply with copyright laws in their respective jurisdictions. We encourage responsible and legal use of GameVault. Unlawful use is strictly improper and unauthorized.
