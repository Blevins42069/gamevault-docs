# Setting up a GameVault Server

Setting up a GameVault server can be done in a few simple steps. Before starting, there are some prerequisites you need to have in place.

There are many ways to deploy a GameVault Server. You can choose one from below.

## Supported Methods

- [Docker Compose](docker-compose)
- [Caprover](caprover)
- [TrueNAS Scale](truenas-scale)
- [UNRAID](unraid)
- [Native](native)

### More Methods

We're excited to announce that we're expanding our support for Setup Integrations! In the future, we plan to add more to our lineup.

We do want to point out that each system has its own unique blueprint syntax, and it can take a bit of time to set up the blueprints of new Integrations just right.

However, we're always looking for passionate individuals to join us in our mission! If you're interested in contributing and setting up an integration for any system, we'd love to have you on board. Together, we can make our platform even more accessible and user-friendly for everyone.

## What Next?

**Congratulations! ðŸ¥³**

To set up and start using server, follow these steps:

1. **Configure your server:** Customize the server settings to meet your specific needs. Refer to the [configuration guide](../configuration.md) for detailed instructions.

2. **Add games:** Prepare your game files in the required format for GameVault to identify and install them correctly. Read the [structure chapter](../structure.md) for important information. Once ready, proceed to [add your games](../adding-games.md).

3. **Enhance with Metadata:** Connect your server to RAWG, the world's largest video game database that GameVault utilizes for fetching game metadata. This will enrich your gaming experience. Learn how to establish the connection in the [indexing and metadata guide](../indexing-and-metadata.md).

4. **Create an admin user:** Set up an admin user account to gain full administrative access to the application. Refer to the [user management guide](../user-management.md) for instructions on setting up the first user.

Enjoy your gaming experience with GameVault!
