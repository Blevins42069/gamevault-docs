### How to Install and Apply a Custom Theme

To install a custom theme, follow these steps:

1. Place the theme .xaml file into your `themes` folder. Depending on your GameVault installation, the `themes` folder can be located at either `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Packages\Phalcode.174950BD81C41_dymsgn3qpfjxc\LocalCache\Roaming\GameVault\themes` or `%APPDATA%/GameVault/themes`.
2. Open `GameVault Settings` and select your newly added theme under `Application` -> `Themes`.

### Creating a Custom Theme

Creating a custom theme is straightforward. You can either use our Theme Generator or create a new .xaml file based on our templates and save it in the `themes` folder.

#### Theme Generator

An easy-to-use Theme Generator is available [here](https://themes.gamevau.lt/).

#### Template File

Just copy one of the existing templates from the [themes repository](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-community-themes/), edit it using a text editor, and save it in the `themes` folder to try it out. Be aware that the hex codes are ARGB syntax and not RGB syntax.

### Sharing Custom Themes

Share your custom themes with the community by creating a pull request to the [themes repository](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-community-themes/).
